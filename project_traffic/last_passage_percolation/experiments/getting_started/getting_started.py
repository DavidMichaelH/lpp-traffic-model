#When you download this repository to your own computer there might be a 
#few things you need to do in order to get started.

#The first thing is you need to copy and paste the file path to the root 
#folder of this project last_passage_percolation
#It should look something like C:/BLAH/BLAH/BLAH/last_passage_percolation"
FILE_PATH_TO_ROOT = "D:/ProjectTraffic/last_passage_percolation/"
 
#Then just run the entire python file. This will tell your IDE where the root file of the project is to make all 
#the import statements work.
