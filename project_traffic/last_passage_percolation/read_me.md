Hello and welcome. 

In order to get started, the first thing you are going to want to do is to go into the experiments folder and 
then into the getting_started folder and open the getting_started.py file and run it in your IDE, e.g. Spyder, Pycharm... 
The reason for doing this is explained in the comments on that file.  

After this then should be able to go into the experiments folder and run the basic_simulation.py file. This file runs a 
the traffic simulation.
